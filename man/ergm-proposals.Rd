\title{Metropolis-Hastings Proposal Methods for ERGM MCMC}
\description{
  \code{\link{ergm}}  uses a Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm to control the behavior of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for sampling networks.  The MCMC chain is intended to step around the sample space of possible networks, selecting a network at regular intervals to evaluate the statistics in the model.  For each MCMC step, \eqn{n} (\eqn{n=1} in the simple case) toggles are proposed to change the dyad(s) to the opposite value. The probability of accepting the proposed change is determined by the MH acceptance ratio.  The role of the different MH methods implemented in \code{\link{ergm}} is to vary how the sets of dyads are selected for toggle proposals.  This is used in some cases to improve the performance (speed and mixing) of the algorithm, and in other cases to constrain the sample space.

        \item{InitErgmProposal.randomtoggle}{Propose a randomly selected dyad to toggle.
        }
        
        \item{InitErgmProposal.TNT}{Default MH algorithm. Stratifies the population of dyads
        	by edge status: those having ties and those having no ties (hence T/NT).  
        	This is useful for improving performance in sparse networks,
        	because it gives at least 50\% chance of proposing a toggle of an existing edge.
        }

        \item{InitErgmProposal.StratTNT}{Stratifies the population of dyads by mixing type
            on a given vertex attribute \code{attr}; within each mixing type, dyads are 
            stratified by edge status as in \code{TNT}.
            
            Specifically, the user may pass a vertex attribute \code{attr} as an argument 
            (the default for \code{attr} gives every vertex the same attribute value),
            and may also pass a matrix of weights \code{pmat} (the default for 
            \code{pmat} gives equal weight to each mixing type).  See 
            \link[=nodal_attributes]{Specifying Vertex Attributes and Levels} for details on 
            specifying vertex attributes.  The matrix \code{pmat}, if specified, must have
            the same dimensions as a mixing matrix for the network and attribute under 
            consideration, and the correspondence between rows and columns of \code{pmat}
            and values of \code{attr} is the same as for a mixing matrix.
                        
            The interpretation is that \code{pmat[i,j]/sum(pmat)} is the probability of 
            proposing a toggle for mixing type \code{(i,j)}.  (For undirected, unipartite
            networks, \code{pmat} is first symmetrized, and then entries below the diagonal 
            are set to zero.  Only entries on or above the diagonal of the symmetrized 
            \code{pmat} are considered when making proposals.  This accounts for the 
            convention that mixing is undirected in an undirected, unipartite network: 
            a tail of type \code{i} and a head of type \code{j} has the same mixing type 
            as a tail of type \code{j} and a head of type \code{i}.) For a given proposal,
            once the mixing type is chosen, an edge or dyad of that mixing type is 
            chosen at random and proposed to be toggled, as in \code{TNT}.
            
            As an alternative way of specifying \code{pmat}, the user may pass 
            \code{empirical=TRUE} to use the mixing matrix of the network beginning 
            the MCMC chain as \code{pmat}.  In order for this to work,
            that network should have a reasonable (in particular, nonempty) edge set.
            
            All arguments must be named in order to be recognized
            by \code{StratTNT}.  While some mixing types may be assigned zero proposal 
            probability, this will not be recognized as a constraint
            by all components of \code{ergm}, and should be used with caution.

    \describe{
        
         \item{InitErgmProposal.CondB1Degree}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~b1degrees}. For bipartite networks, randomly select an edge {B1i, B2j} and an empty dyad with the same node B1i, {B1i, B2k}, and propose to toggle both {B1i, B2j} and {B1i, B2k}. This ensures that the degrees of individual nodes in mode 1 are preserved.
        }
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondB2Degree}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~b2degrees}. For bipartite network, randomly select an edge {B1j, B2i} and an empty dyad with the same node B2i, {B1k, B2i}, and propose to toggle both {B1j, B2i} and {B1k, B2i}. This ensures that the degrees of individual nodes in mode 2 are preserved.
        }
        
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondDegree}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~degree}. Propose either 4 toggles (MH_CondDegreeTetrad) or 6 toggles (MH_CondDegreeHexad) at once. For undirected networks, propose 4 toggles (MH_CondDegreeTetrad). MH_CondDegreeTetrad selects two edges with no nodes in common, A1-A2 and B1-B2, s.t. A1-B2 and B1-A2 are not edges, and propose to replace the former two by the latter two. MH_CondDegreeHexad selects three edges A1->A2, B1->B2, C1->C2 at random and rotate them to A1->B2, B1->C2, and C1->A2.
        }
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondDegreeDist}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~degreedist}. Randomly select a node (T) and its edge (E).  If the head node of the edge (H) has 1 degree more than another randomly select node (A), and A is disconnected to both T and H, then propose to toggle E and the dyad between T and A.
        }
        
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondDegreeMix}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~degreesmix}. Similar to \code{InitErgmProposal.CondDegree}, except that the toggle is proposed only if the mixing matrix of degrees is preserved before and after the toggle.}
        
        \item{InitErgmProposal.ConstantEdges}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~edges}. Propose pairs of toggles that keep number of edges the same. This is done by (a) choosing an existing edge at random; (b) repeatedly choosing dyads at random until one is found that does not have an edge; and (c) proposing toggling both these dyads. Note that step (b) will be very inefficient if the network is nearly complete, so this proposal is NOT recommended for such networks. However, most network datasets are sparse, so this is not likely to be an issue.
        }   
        
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondInDegreeDist}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~idegreedist}. For directed networks, similar to InitErgmProposal.CondDegreeDist, except for indegree case
        }
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondOutDegreeDist}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~odegreedist}. For directed networks, similar to InitErgmProposal.CondDegreeDist, except for outdegree case
        }

	\item{InitErgmProposal.fixedas}{MHp for \eqn{constraints=~fixedas(present,absent)}. Select a random dyad that is not in either 'present' edgelist or 'absent' edgelist to toggle. Edges in 'present' and empty dyads in 'absent' are remained fixed.}
	
	\item{InitErgmProposal.fixedasTNT}{Similar to InitErgmProposal.fixedas, except that it selects ties
        and non-ties for proposed toggles with equal probability.  Like the unconstrained TNT proposal, this is useful for improving performance in sparse networks.}	
	
			
	\item{InitErgmProposal.fixallbut}{MHp for \eqn{constraints=~fixallbut(free.dyads)}. Select a random dyad that is in free.dyads edgelist to toggle.}
  
  \item{InitErgmProposal.fixallbutTNT}{Similar to InitErgmProposal.fixallbut, except that it selects ties and non-ties for proposed toggles with equal probability.  Like the unconstrained TNT proposal, this is useful for improving performance in sparse networks.}
  
  
        \item{InitErgmProposal.randomtoggleNonObserved}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~observed}. Randomly select a missing/non-observed dyad and propose a toggle.
        }

	\item{InitErgmProposal.NonObservedTNT}{Similar to InitErgmProposal.randomtoggleNonObserved, except that it selects ties and non-ties for proposed toggles with equal probability.  Like the unconstrained TNT proposal, this is useful for improving performance in sparse networks.
        }
	
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondInDegree}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~idegrees}. For directed networks, randomly select two dyads with a common head node, one having an edge one not, and propose to swap the tie from one tail to the other.
        }
        \item{InitErgmProposal.CondOutDegree}{MHp for \eqn{constraints= ~odegrees}. For directed networks, randomly select two dyads with a common tail node, one having an edge and one not, and propose to swap the tie from one head to the other.
        }

        \item{InitErgmProposal.BDTNT}{Implements a TNT proposal with an upper bound on degree.  Optionally prohibits certain mixing types on a specified attribute.
        
        Specifically, the user may pass an upper bound for total degree via the \code{bound}
                    argument (the default \code{bound} is the network size minus one), and may also pass an 
                    attribute \code{attr} (the default \code{attr} gives every vertex the same attribute value)
                    and a logical matrix \code{fmat} indicating which mixing types of \code{attr}
                    are forbidden from having ties (the default \code{fmat} allows all mixing types).  
                    See \link[=nodal_attributes]{Specifying Vertex Attributes and Levels}
                    for details on specifying vertex attributes.  The matrix \code{fmat}, if specified, must have
                    the same dimensions as a mixing matrix for the network and attribute under
                    consideration, and the correspondence between rows and columns of \code{fmat}
                    and values of \code{attr} is the same as for a mixing matrix.
                   
        The interpretation is that \code{fmat[i,j]} is \code{FALSE} if the attribute pairing
                    \code{(i,j)} is not forbidden, and \code{fmat[i,j]} is \code{TRUE} if the attribute pairing
                    \code{(i,j)} is forbidden.  Undirected, unipartite networks are considered to have undirected mixing,
                    and the pairing \code{(i,j)} is forbidden if either \code{fmat[i,j]} is \code{TRUE} or
                    \code{fmat[j,i]} is \code{TRUE}.  Bipartite networks are also supported, and are considered
                    to have directed mixing, so \code{(i,j)} is forbidden iff \code{fmat[i,j]} is \code{TRUE}.
        
        Directed networks are not supported by \code{BDTNT} at this time.
        
        All arguments must be named in order to be recognized by \code{BDTNT}.  
                    While some mixing types may be forbidden by \code{fmat}, this will not be
                    recognized as a constraint by all components of \code{ergm}, and should
                    be used with caution.
        }

        \item{InitErgmProposal.BDStratTNT}{Implements a TNT proposal with an upper bound on degree, with proposed
                    toggles stratified by mixing type on a specified vertex attribute.  Optionally prohibits certain
                    mixing types on a(nother) specified attribute.
        
        Specifically, the user may pass arguments \code{bound}, \code{BD_attr}, and \code{fmat} as for \code{BDTNT},
                    and may also pass arguments \code{Strat_attr} and \code{pmat} as for \code{StratTNT}.  Proposals 
                    are made based on mixing type according to \code{pmat} and \code{Strat_attr}, respecting constraints 
                    imposed by \code{bound}, \code{BD_attr}, and \code{fmat}.  See \code{BDTNT} and \code{StratTNT} for
                    more information.  The \code{empirical=TRUE} option for specifying \code{pmat} is also supported,
                    as for \code{StratTNT}.
                    
        Directed networks are not supported by \code{BDStratTNT} at this time.
