}
\arguments{
\item{object}{formula object to be updated}

\item{\dots}{additional parameters for model formulation}

\item{formula}{a formula of the form \code{network ~ model.term(s)}}

\item{nw}{the network of interest}

\item{response}{charcter, name of edge attribute containing edge weights}

\item{silent}{logical, whether to print the warning messages from the
initialization of each model term; default=FALSE}

\item{role}{A hint about how the model will be used. Used primarily for
dynamic network models.}

\item{form}{same as formula, a formula of the form \code{network ~ model.term(s)}}

\item{loopswarning}{whether warnings about loops should be printed (T or
F);default=TRUE}

\item{new}{new formula to be used in updating}

\item{from.new}{logical or character vector of variable names. controls how
environment of formula gets updated.}
}
\value{
\code{ergm_model} returns an  \code{ergm_model} object as a list
containing:
\item{ formula}{the formula inputted to
\code{\link{ergm.getmodel}}}
\item{coef.names}{a vector of coefficient names}
\item{offset}{a logical vector of whether each term was "offset", i.e.
fixed}
\item{terms}{a list of terms and 'term components' initialized by the
appropriate \code{InitErgmTerm.X} function.}
\item{network.stats0}{NULL always??}
\item{etamap}{the theta -> eta mapping as a list returned from
<ergm.etamap>}

\code{ergm.getnetwork} returns: \itemize{ \item the network
from the formula IF (i) the formula was correctly structured and
(ii) the network is found within the formula's enviornment }

\code{ergm.getterms} returns: \itemize{ \item the terms
object associated with the formula and returned by the native R
function \code{\link{terms}}. see
\code{\link[stats]{terms.object}} for details about the
components }
}
\description{
These are all functions that are generally not called directly by
users, but may be employed by other depending packages.  The
\code{ergm.getmodel} function parses the given formula, and
initiliazes each ergm term via the \code{InitErgmTerm} functions to
create a \code{ergm_model} object.

\code{ergm.getmodel} is a deprecated name for the \code{ergm_model.formula} method.

The \code{ergm.getnetwork} function ensures that the
network in a given formula is valid; if so, the network is
returned; if not, execution is halted with warnings

DEPRECATED. The \code{ergm.getterms} function returns the terms of
a given formula and ensures that the formula is indeed a formula
with the necessary \code{~} operator

\code{ergm.update.formula} (DEPRECATED: use
\code{\link[statnet.common]{nonsimp_update.formula}} instead) is a
reimplementation of \code{\link{update.formula}} that does not
simplify.  Note that the resulting formula's environment is set as
follows. If \code{from.new==FALSE}, it is set to that of
object. Otherwise, a new sub-environment of object, containing, in
addition, variables in new listed in from.new (if a character
vector) or all of new (if TRUE).

\code{remove.offset.formula} deletes all \code{\link{offset}} terms in
an ERGM formula.

\code{offset.info.formula} returns the offset
vectors associated with a formula.

These functions are not meant to be called by the end-user but may be useful to extension developers. This API is not to be considered fixed and may change between versions.
