This document is an automatically generated cross reference for the ergm model terms from the [stanet project](http://statnet.org).  The source for this data and additional descriptions are in the `?ergm.terms` help file or the [ergm manual](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ergm/ergm.pdf). 


```{r, include=FALSE}
library(ergm)
rawdoc<-tools:::parse_Rd('../man/ergm-terms.Rd')
termBlock<-ergm:::.extractTermBlock(rawdoc)
items<-ergm:::.extractTags(termBlock,"\\item")
terms<-lapply(items,ergm:::.extractTerms)
terms<-unlist(terms,recursive=FALSE)
```

## Term category matrix
Some terms are listed multiple times because their arguments give them multiple forms

```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
ergm:::.termMatrix(terms)
```


## Term definitions table

Some terms are listed multiple times because their arguments give them multiple forms

```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
ergm:::.termTable(terms)
```

## Term index by category

Note that currently the categories are somewhat ambiguous in their exclusivity.  For example, a term marked as 'directed' can not be used with an undirected network, but a term not marked with either 'directed' or 'undirected' can be used with both. (rename to 'directed-only' ?)

```{r,results='asis',echo=FALSE}
ergm:::.termToc(terms)
```
