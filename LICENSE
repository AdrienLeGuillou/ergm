====================

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating 'statnet'",
for use by other researchers. We require that the attributions
in the software are retained (even if only pieces of it are used),
and that there is attribution when the package is loaded (e.g., via
"library" or "require"). This is the default, and is it stop
"rebadging" of the software. 

One core part of credit is academic citation (i.e., citing the package in
papers based on work that uses the package). We have a cite we want people
to use:

Mark S. Handcock, David R. Hunter, Carter T. Butts, Steven M.
Goodreau, and Martina Morris (2003) "statnet: A suite of R packages
for the Statistical Modeling of Social Networks." URL
http://statnetproject.org.

Please cite it in all papers where it is used.
