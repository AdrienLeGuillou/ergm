This software is distributed under the GPL-3 license with the
following requirements:
(1) you agree to retain in "ergm" and any modifications to
     "ergm" the copyright, author attribution and URL
     information as provided at http://statnetproject.org/attribution.
(2) you agree that "ergm" and any modifications to
     "ergm" will display when used the attribution:

What does this mean? :-)
====================

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating 'ergm'
for use by other researchers (as distinct from software for our own use).
We require that the attributions in the software are retained 
(even if only pieces of it are used), and that there is attribution when 
the package is loaded (e.g., via "library" or "require"). 
This is the default, so you only need to do something if you are going to modify
or reuse the source.

One core part of credit for most of us is academic citation (i.e.,
citing the package in papers based on work that uses the package).  We
therefore ask that you cite the package when you use it in papers.

For specific text that can be used for various types of citations,
use the command:

citation("ergm")

Enjoy!
