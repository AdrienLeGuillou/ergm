This software is distributed under the GPL-3 license with the
following requirements:
(1) you agree to retain in "ergm" and any modifications to
     "ergm" the copyright, author attribution and URL
     information as provided at http://statnetproject.org/attribution.
(2) you agree that "ergm" and any modifications to
     "ergm" will display when used the attribution:
     "Based on 'statnet' project software (http://statnetproject.org),
      to be cited as in http://statnetproject.org/cite"

What does this mean? :-)
====================

We have invested a lot of time and effort in creating 'ergm'
for use by other researchers. We require that the attributions
in the software are retained (even if only pieces of it are used),
and that there is attribution when the package is loaded (e.g., via
"library" or "require"). This is the default, and is it to stop
"rebadging" of the software.

One core part of credit for most of us is academic citation (i.e.,
citing the package in papers based on work that uses the package).  We
therefore ask that when you use 'ergm' in papers, you include the following
citation:

Mark S. Handcock, David R. Hunter, Carter T. Butts, Steven M.
Goodreau, and Martina Morris (2003) "statnet: A suite of R packages
for the Statistical Modeling of Social Networks." URL
http://statnetproject.org.
